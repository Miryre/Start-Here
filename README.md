# StartHere 🎓

**Your guide to affordable college living**

StartHere is a community-driven web application that helps college students discover affordable resources in their college town - from cheap eats and thrift stores to mental health services and career support.

---

## 🎯 The Problem

College students often struggle to find:

- Affordable food options beyond campus dining
- Budget-friendly clothing and professional attire
- Mental health and wellness resources
- Emergency financial assistance
- Free or low-cost activities and entertainment
- Career development opportunities

These resources exist, but they're scattered across websites, social media, and word-of-mouth - making them hard to discover when you need them most.

---

## 💡 The Solution

StartHere brings all these resources together in one place, with:

- **Location-based search** - Find resources near campus or your location
- **Student reviews & tips** - Real feedback from fellow students
- **Community-driven** - Students helping students by sharing hidden gems
- **Budget filters** - Filter by free, $, $$, or $$$
- **Categories that matter** - Food, Clothing, Self-Care, Emergency Aid, Academic Support, Activities, and Career Resources
